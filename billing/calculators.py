class BillSplitter:
    """
    Handles splitting medical bills among family members based on:
    - Insurance coverage calculations
    - Family account split rules
    
    Key Features:
    - Supports multiple split methods (equal, percentage, default)
    - Integrates with InsuranceCalculator for coverage details
    - Tracks insurance-covered vs personal responsibility amounts
    
    Usage Example:
    --------------
    bill = Bill.objects.get(id=123)
    splitter = BillSplitter(bill)
    splitter.calculate_shares()
